-YouTube Audio Downloader
This is one of my first personal projects that I wanted to do. I wanted an easy & quick way to get an MP3 track from a YouTube video onto my phone so I could play it to my son (who's 20 months old at time of writing this) at bedtime. It's relaxing Disney music so works well but I found it frustrating waiting for the adverts every night.

I've utilised my knowledge of Python with Flask and a library called Pytube to create a simple landing page with a URL input that then shows the available audio streams on a 2nd page. I've recently been learning how to use Bootstrap 5 so have implemented the design with that using a modal popup to confirm the download.

Thanks for visting and please feel free to drop me a message with any questions.

I'm excited to move onto the next project and continue to learn, improve and grow as a developer.

Thanks, James
